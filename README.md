What's Working

Currently can fetch weather from the current conditions API. Enter the city name and the 2-digit country code to pull weather.
Weather conditions will display.
Icon for the prevailing conditions is pulled from API endpoint as well.

Routes are working though not all are configured.

Data is being fetched from the Forecast API (and logged to the console) but not currently displaying on screen.

Not Working 
Map and Alerts are not yet implemented.
Currently the weather and forecast are being pulled from separate form inputs but this will be merged into one with a handleSubmit method shortly.
